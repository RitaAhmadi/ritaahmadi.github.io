I am a stipendiary lecturer at Mansfield College, at University of Oxford. Before that, I was postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Mathematics, Imperial College London. I did my DPhil at Quantum Group based at the Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford. During my PhD, I worked on topological quantum computation and category theory. In my thesis, I studied and proposed bicategorical structures for topological quantum computation.
